----

Lucene/Solr 8.0 and Elasticsearch 7.0 is comming...

## Summary of this talk

* Top-k query processing / scoring will be much faster!
* Especially effective in disjunction (OR) query
* Also works for complex queries such as PhraseQuery, WildcardQuery and their combinations
* Correct total hits count will not be returned (in default)

## And there is a long version...

This talk is a short version of my survey.

Please see this post (in Japanese) for more details :)

## How much faster? - AND query

## How much faster? - OR query (1)

## How much faster? - OR query (2)

## How much faster? - Term query

## Algorithms

## Posting list retrieval and the challenge on disjunction

Query "search OR engine"

![](image/disjunction.png)

## MaxScore

- Introduced by H.R.Turtle and J.Flood in 1995

![](image/maxscore.png)

## Interval-based pruning

- MaxScore variant adopted to block compressed indexes [2]

![](image/interval_pruning.png){width=80%}

## WAND

- Special operator proposed in [3]
- "WAND" is the abbreviation for "Week AND" or "Weighted AND"
- OR is being close to AND when a document contains a large enough subset of the query terms
- Score of a document having a large subset of the query terms is higher than the ones of documents with a few of them

## Sounds familiar?

Lucene already has similar concept :

"Minimum Should Match"

## WAND

Query "the OR search OR engine OR lucene"

![](image/wand.png){width=80%}

## WAND

Steps

1. Assume current threshold (kth highest score) is 12.
2. Sort postings by current pointer.
3. Find "pivot" term and docid - here, that is "search" and id=486.
4. Calculate the partial score for doc 486 if it also contains "the" and "engine".

## Block-max WAND

- WAND variant working with block compressed indexes [4]
- Finally come in Lucene!

## Dive into Implementation

## Disclaimer

- This is about low-level, complex part of Lucene. Could include mistakes... üôÇ
- Lucene API can be rapidly changed. This is based on branch_8_0 branch.

## [ANN] Luke has been revised!

GUI tool for introspecting and debugging your Lucene/Solr/Elasticsearch index.

## [ANN] Luke has been revised!

- Eventually rewritten on top of Swing ... in 2019? [It's a long story](https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/issues/109) :)
- Licenced under ALv2 and works fine with JDK11+
- Popular in US, Europe and China
- Still big growth potential in Japan ü§î
